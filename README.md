# MIS Example
## Setting up a local [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com) environment


### Download and install VirtualBox (>= 5.x) from [here](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).

### Download and install Vagrant (>= 1.8.1) from [here](http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads-archive.html).

### Add the vagrant ssh key to your .ssh directory
- `$ ln -s ~/.vagrant.d/insecure_private_key ~/.ssh/vagrant_insecure_private_key`
- `$ chmod 600 ~/.ssh/vagrant_insecure_private_key`

### Add mcdev top level domain to your ssh config by editing [home]/.ssh/config and adding the following lines
    Host *.mcdev
        ForwardAgent yes
        IdentityFile ~/.ssh/vagrant_insecure_private_key
        User vagrant

### Clone these repos into the directory of your choice:
- `$ git clone git@bitbucket.org:mediacurrent/mis_vagrant_example.git`

### Initialize the submodules to get the mis_example codebase
- `$ cd mis_vagrant_example`
- `$ git submodule init && git submodule update --remote`
- `$ git submodule foreach git checkout develop`

The Example codebase ( git@bitbucket.org:mediacurrent/mis_example.git_)
is now installed in the "mis_example" directory.

### Edit your local `/etc/hosts` file to include the new box ips
    192.168.50.4 example.mcdev

### Start the box from the `mis_vagrant_example` directory
- `$ vagrant up`
*You may be prompted for your sudo password for the NFS mount*

### Install site

@example.mcdev

* `$ cd path/to/docroot`

* `$ drush @example.mcdev si minimal --sites-subdir='example.mcdev' --db-url='mysql://root:password@localhost/example_mcdev' --account-mail='nothing@example.com' --account-name='admin' --account-pass='password' --site-name='Example' --site-mail='nothing@example.com' -y`

* `$ chmod -R ugo+w sites/example.mcdev/files`

### Generate a login link
- `$ cd path/to/docroot`
- `$ drush @example.mcdev uli`
  or
- `$ vagrant ssh`
- `$ cd /home/vagrant/docroot/sites/example.mcdev`
- `$ drush uli`

- Log out of the vagrant server (ctrl-d usually works well)

### Run the Coding Standards tests.

*NOTE* There will be not tests run until modules are in the "sites/all/modules/custom" directory.

- `$ vagrant ssh -c "/vagrant/tests/code-sniffer.sh /home/vagrant/docroot"`

### Run the Security Review tests.
(Drupal 7 only)

- `$ vagrant ssh -c "/vagrant/tests/security-review.sh example.mcdev /home/vagrant/docroot"`

### Run the Accessibility tests.

- `$ vagrant ssh -c "/vagrant/tests/pa11y/pa11y-review.sh example.mcdev"`

### Run the BDD system tests.

- `$ vagrant ssh -c "/vagrant/tests/behat/behat-run.sh http://example.mcdev"`
- To run individual tests or further configuration. See tests/behat/README.md

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/geerlingguy/drupal-vm.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/geerlingguy/drupal-vm) [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/drupal-vm/badge/?version=latest)](http://docs.drupalvm.com) [![Packagist](https://img.shields.io/packagist/v/geerlingguy/drupal-vm.svg)](https://packagist.org/packages/geerlingguy/drupal-vm)

[Drupal VM](http://www.drupalvm.com/) is A VM for local Drupal development, built with Vagrant + Ansible.

This project aims to make spinning up a simple local Drupal test/development environment incredibly quick and easy, and to introduce new developers to the wonderful world of Drupal development on local virtual machines (instead of crufty old MAMP/WAMP-based development).

It will install the following on an Ubuntu 16.04 (by default) linux VM:

  - Apache 2.4.x (or Nginx 1.x)
  - PHP 7.0.x (configurable)
  - MySQL 5.7.x
  - Drush (configurable)
  - Drupal 7.x, or 8.x.x (configurable)
  - Optional:
    - Drupal Console
    - Varnish 4.x (configurable)
    - Apache Solr 4.10.x (configurable)
    - Node.js 0.12 (configurable)
    - Selenium, for testing your sites via Behat
    - Ruby
    - Memcached
    - Redis
    - SQLite
    - XHProf, for profiling your code
    - Blackfire, for profiling your code
    - XDebug, for debugging your code
    - Adminer, for accessing databases directly
    - Pimp my Log, for easy viewing of log files
    - MailHog, for catching and debugging email

It should take 5-10 minutes to build or rebuild the VM from scratch on a decent broadband connection.

Please read through the rest of this README and the [Drupal VM documentation](http://docs.drupalvm.com/) for help getting Drupal VM configured and integrated with your development workflow.

## Documentation

Full Drupal VM documentation is available at http://docs.drupalvm.com/

## Customizing the VM

There are a couple places where you can customize the VM for your needs:

  - `config.yml`: Override any of the default VM configuration from `default.config.yml`; customize almost any aspect of any software installed in the VM (more about [overriding configurations](http://docs.drupalvm.com/en/latest/other/overriding-configurations/).
  - `drupal.composer.json` or `drupal.make.yml`: Contains configuration for the Drupal core version, modules, and patches that will be downloaded on Drupal's initial installation (you can build using Composer, Drush make, or your own codebase).

If you want to switch from Drupal 8 (default) to Drupal 7 on the initial install, do the following:

  1. Switch to using a [Drush Make file](http://docs.drupalvm.com/en/latest/deployment/drush-make/).
  1. Update the Drupal `version` and `core` inside the `drupal.make.yml` file.
  2. Update `drupal_major_version` inside `config.yml`.

## Quick Start Guide

This Quick Start Guide will help you quickly build a Drupal 8 site on the Drupal VM using Composer with `drupal-project`. You can also use Drupal VM with [Composer](http://docs.drupalvm.com/en/latest/deployment/composer/), a [Drush Make file](http://docs.drupalvm.com/en/latest/deployment/drush-make/), with a [Local Drupal codebase](http://docs.drupalvm.com/en/latest/deployment/local-codebase/), or even a [Drupal multisite installation](http://docs.drupalvm.com/en/latest/deployment/multisite/).

If you want to install a Drupal 8 site locally with minimal fuss, just:

  1. Install Vagrant.
  2. Download or clone this project to your workstation.
  3. `cd` into this project directory and run `vagrant up`.

But Drupal VM allows you to build your site exactly how you like, using whatever tools you need, with almost infinite flexibility and customization!

### 1 - Install Vagrant

Download and install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html).

Vagrant will automatically install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) if no providers are available (Drupal VM also works with Parallels or VMware, if you have the [Vagrant VMware integration plugin](http://www.vagrantup.com/vmware)).

Notes:

  - **For faster provisioning** (Mac/Linux only): *[Install Ansible](http://docs.ansible.com/intro_installation.html) on your host machine, so Drupal VM can run the provisioning steps locally instead of inside the VM.*
  - **NFS on Linux**: *If NFS is not already installed on your host, you will need to install it to use the default NFS synced folder configuration. See guides for [Debian/Ubuntu](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-an-nfs-mount-on-ubuntu-14-04), [Arch](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/NFS#Installation), and [RHEL/CentOS](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-an-nfs-mount-on-centos-6).*
  - **Versions**: *Make sure you're running the latest releases of Vagrant, VirtualBox, and Ansibleâ€”as of February 2016, Drupal VM recommends: Vagrant 1.8.1, VirtualBox 5.0.20, and Ansible 2.1.0.*

### 2 - Build the Virtual Machine

  1. Download this project and put it wherever you want.
  2. (Optional) Copy `default.config.yml` to `config.yml` and modify it to your liking.
  3. Create a local directory where Drupal will be installed and configure the path to that directory in `config.yml` (`local_path`, inside `vagrant_synced_folders`).
  4. Open Terminal, `cd` to this directory (containing the `Vagrantfile` and this README file).
  5. Type in `vagrant up`, and let Vagrant do its magic.

Once the process is complete, you will have a Drupal codebase available inside the `drupal/` directory of the project.

Note: *If there are any errors during the course of running `vagrant up`, and it drops you back to your command prompt, just run `vagrant provision` to continue building the VM from where you left off. If there are still errors after doing this a few times, post an issue to this project's issue queue on GitHub with the error.*

### 3 - Configure your host machine to access the VM.

  1. [Edit your hosts file](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/how-do-i-modify-my-hosts-file), adding the line `192.168.88.88  drupalvm.dev` so you can connect to the VM.
    - You can have Vagrant automatically configure your hosts file if you install the `hostsupdater` plugin (`vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostsupdater`). All hosts defined in `apache_vhosts` or `nginx_hosts` will be automatically managed. `vagrant-hostmanager` is also supported.
    - The `auto_network` plugin (`vagrant plugin install vagrant-auto_network`) can help with IP address management if you set `vagrant_ip` to `0.0.0.0` inside `config.yml`.
  2. Open your browser and access [http://drupalvm.dev/](http://drupalvm.dev/). The default login for the admin account is `admin` for both the username and password.

## Extra software/utilities

By default, this VM includes the extras listed in the `config.yml` option `installed_extras`:

    installed_extras:
      - adminer
      # - blackfire
      - drupalconsole
      - mailhog
      # - memcached
      # - newrelic
      # - nodejs
      - pimpmylog
      # - redis
      # - ruby
      # - selenium
      # - solr
      - varnish
      # - xdebug
      # - xhprof

If you don't want or need one or more of these extras, just delete them or comment them from the list. This is helpful if you want to reduce PHP memory usage or otherwise conserve system resources.

## Using Drupal VM

Drupal VM is built to integrate with every developer's workflow. Many guides for using Drupal VM for common development tasks are available on the [Drupal VM documentation site](http://docs.drupalvm.com).

## Updating Drupal VM

Drupal VM follows semantic versioning, which means your configuration should continue working (potentially with very minor modifications) throughout a major release cycle. Here is the process to follow when updating Drupal VM between minor releases:

  1. Read through the [release notes](https://github.com/geerlingguy/drupal-vm/releases) and add/modify `config.yml` variables mentioned therein.
  2. Do a diff of your `config.yml` with the updated `default.config.yml` (e.g. `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/geerlingguy/drupal-vm/master/default.config.yml | git diff --no-index config.yml -`).
  3. Run `vagrant provision` to provision the VM, incorporating all the latest changes.

For major version upgrades (e.g. 2.x.x to 3.x.x), it may be simpler to destroy the VM (`vagrant destroy`) then build a fresh new VM (`vagrant up`) using the new version of Drupal VM.

## System Requirements

Drupal VM runs on almost any modern computer that can run VirtualBox and Vagrant, however for the best out-of-the-box experience, it's recommended you have a computer with at least:

  - Intel Core processor with VT-x enabled
  - At least 4 GB RAM (higher is better)
  - An SSD (for greater speed with synced folders)

## Other Notes

  - To shut down the virtual machine, enter `vagrant halt` in the Terminal in the same folder that has the `Vagrantfile`. To destroy it completely (if you want to save a little disk space, or want to rebuild it from scratch with `vagrant up` again), type in `vagrant destroy`.
  - To log into the virtual machine, enter `vagrant ssh`. You can also get the machine's SSH connection details with `vagrant ssh-config`.
  - When you rebuild the VM (e.g. `vagrant destroy` and then another `vagrant up`), make sure you clear out the contents of the `drupal` folder on your host machine, or Drupal will return some errors when the VM is rebuilt (it won't reinstall Drupal cleanly).
  - You can change the installed version of Drupal or drush, or any other configuration options, by editing the variables within `config.yml`.
